## Project Description

The project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments using **unsupervised learning algorithms** such as **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering**. Key functionalities of the project include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, normalize and scale features.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Apply **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** to segment the customer base.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use techniques like **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to assess the quality of segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize customer segments using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, or create interactive dashboards with **Power BI**/**Tableau**.
- **Deployment** (Optional): Deploy the model for real-time customer segmentation using **AWS** or **Google Cloud**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for data analysis and model building.
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation.  
  - **NumPy** for numerical operations.  
  - **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models.  
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.  
  - **Power BI** or **Tableau** for business intelligence (optional).
- **Cloud** (Optional):  
  - **AWS** for scalable model deployment and cloud services.  
  - **Google Cloud** for model storage and deployment.
